            <p> Dear Nkosi,</p>
            <p>I hope that you are feeling ecstatic about finally making it through college, despite all the challenges. As I am writing this, I am listening to all the recordings we have ever done. Trying to think of how to express how proud I am of you. When we first met briefly at discovery tour and then again on case green, I never thought we would accomplish and experience the many powerful moments that we have had together. Looking back, I can say that getting through college was easier because of knowing and growing with you.</p>

            <p> In the time I have known you, I have became a better man. Our deep, vulnerable and honest conversations about love and life are very special to me. I am glad that you are the friend that I trust to see me cry and helped me through my worst moments. It is because of those moments of honesty and sharing that I have grown as a man.  I have opened up more about my emotions and my mistakes. I have been able to better understand my life. </p>

            <p> I think what makes you a beautiful person - Nkosi,  is that you are  a very empathetic and joyful individual. After experiencing your world, I  was amazed that you have maintained your unique bubblines. Your struggles in life made you look deeply at yourself and as a result helped you better connect and bring  joy to others. I very much admire that about you. I hope you never lose that and use that joy and empathy to lead you through your next phase in life. </p>
